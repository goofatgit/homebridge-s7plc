# homebridge-s7plc
homebridge plugin for S7 PLC connect

Connects homebridge with Siemens S7 PLC

Create Lamp Accessories which will act like Homebridge devices.

Devices are controlled via a DB in the PLC.

Homebridge will check the Output of PLC to get the actual state when you start the app on your phone.

When homebridge wants to turn the device on it will set an onbit (WriteByte.WriteBitOn) in the specified DB. 
When homebridge wants to turn the device off it will set an offbit (WriteByte.WriteBitOff) in the DB.
The Output is checked directly from the PLC Output A(ReadByte.ReadBit)

So you have to take care that the DB is there

After you used the bits to switch your output you have to reset them in the PLC like this

//Bit in DB switches Output(Lamp) on
U DB20.DBX0.0
S A0.5
//Bit in DB switches Output off
U DB20.DBX0.1
R A0.5

//after switching is done reset on bit
U DB20.DBX0.0
U A0.5
R DB20.DBX0.0
//reset off bit
U DB20.DBX0.1
UN A0.5
R DB20.DBX0.1

Have fun!
